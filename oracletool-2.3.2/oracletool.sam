# Uncomment and set the (local) ORACLE_HOME environmental variable
# if neccessary. You may get messages in your web servers error log
# if this is not set.
# Win32 users may not need to set this at all.

 ORACLE_HOME = /apps/oracle/product/10/rdbms

# Set the TNS_ADMIN variable if the directory you keep your tnsnames.ora file in
# is not the default.  Default is $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin
# You may also want to set this if you want only a subset of
# your databases accessible from this tool. To do this,
# you would create a new tnsnames.ora file with only
# the connections you want, and put that in a non-default
# directory. Then, set this variable to point to that
# directory.
# If your installation uses the default, then you can comment this out.
#
# Win32 users: You probably already know this, but your entry should
# look something like this..
#
# TNS_ADMIN = C:\\ORANT\\NETWORK\\ADMIN

 TNS_ADMIN = /apps/oracle/admin/sqlnet

# The following variable is set to expire the username/password cookies
# after a certain period of time. The default is one year.
# NOTE: If you are using Internet explorer and are having problems
# with these cookies, consider upgrading the CGI.pm module to the
# latest release. It worked for me...

 EXPIRATION = +1y

# The following are all valid examples for the expiration time, and are
# taken straight out of Lincoln Stein's CGI::Cookie man page.

#=====================================================================
# All of the parameters from here on are considered strictly optional,
# and you don't have to set any of them for Oracletool to function.
# You may want to quickly browse through them to see if any interest
# you.
#=====================================================================

# Uncomment the following variable if you are running Oracle names.
# This will bring up an additional text entry box to enter a names
# resolved database.
# This parameter is optional.

# ORACLENAMES = Yep

# Debug?
# Debug will send information about each subroutine to
# the log specified below in the "log" parameter. A
# message will display in the menu column that shows that
# debugging is turned on. Be sure to set a log file below.
# This parameter is optional.

# DEBUG = Yep

# Logging?
# Logging will log the REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_ADDR, $database
# $object_type, and $theme to the log specified below in
# the "log" parameter. A message will display in the menu
# column that shows that logging is turned on. Be sure to
# set a log file below.
# This parameter is optional.

# LOGGING = Yep

# Name of the log file for debug / log messages to be written.
# Only neccessary if you are in debug or log mode above. If 
# you uncomment logging and / or debug above, but do not set
# this parameter, debug and logging will be ignored.
# This parameter is optional.

# LOG = /tmp/debuglog

# Auto refresh increment for auto-refreshing screens. (seconds)
# This parameter is optional.

 AUTO_REFRESH = 15

# Schema name for the owner of Statspack objects, if you use it.
# This parameter is optional, and defaults to PERFSTAT

 STATSPACK_SCHEMA = PERFSTAT

# Limit, in bytes, for file uploads into MyOracletool
# Note that the perl DBI has to load the file being uploaded
# completely into memory before insertion into the database.
# This is not an Oracletool limitation, it's the DBI.
# This parameter is optional, and defaults to unlimited.

# UPLOAD_LIMIT = 1048576

# This was requested because the search function was taking up too
# much resources when checking to see whether an object found was 
# in use by a connected session. This will turn off that portion of
# the search. You may want to set this if you have a large number
# (like thousands) of simultaneous connections to your database.
# This parameter is optional.

# LIMIT_SEARCH = Yep

# As of v1.05, most SQL statements have the Oracletool copyright
# embedded in them. By commenting this out, that will not happen.
# This parameter is optional.

# DISPLAY_COPYRIGHT = Yep

# This variable should be set to something other than what this is
# currently set to. This is the string which will be used to encrypt
# and decrypt the cookies being sent over the network. Just set it 
# to something that no one will guess.

 ENCRYPTION_STRING = CHANGEME

# This variable pertains to encryption methods. Currently, IDEA and
# BLOWFISH are supported, assuming the relevent perl modules are installed.

 ENCRYPTION_METHOD = blowfish

# Description of "Plugin" tools.
# The value of "plugin" is what will show up in the Oracletool Menu.
# The value of "program" is the actual name of the program the webserver
# will look for.  Keep in mind that the pathname you use here must be
# an absolute or relative pathname to the WEBSERVER, not to the filesystem.
# Using no pathname will tell the webserver that the plugin is in the
# same directory as Oracletool. This is the recommended setup.
# This parameter is optional.

# PLUGIN = Tar tracker
# PROGRAM = ../tartracker/tartracker.pl
