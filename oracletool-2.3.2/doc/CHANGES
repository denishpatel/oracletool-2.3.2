   2.3.2   24 Feb 2010

Enhancements
============

   Added section for flashback information. "Redo / Archives" menu item changed to "Redo / Flashback".
   Under locks / contends, if a session is locking another session, you can click on that SID, and it will
   take you directly to the detailed session info for that problem session.

Bug Fixes
=========

   Deleting scripts within MyOracletool not working, fixed. Thanks to Bryce Tutt for pointing it out.

   2.3   Not released to public 

   No longer testing with oracle 7 / 8 / 9 

Enhancements
============

   Added section for ASM disk groups / disks
   Added Bind variable information for SQL in the shared SQL area. (10g)
   Added datapump job monitor under "Sessions" section (10g).
   Added more undo / rollback info (Synopsis)
   Added more temp segment information
   Enhanced session summary w/refresh
   Enhanced individual session display, many changes
   
Bug Fixes
=========

   Fixed Redo / Archives section to show archiving info for 10g databases if archiving 
   is enabled.

   Fixed bug in 10G databases, connected users not highlighted in Schema list area.


   2.2   18 Jan 2005

Enhancements
============

   Added "seconds waiting" column to session summary w/refresh to show how
   long each session has been waiting on an event.

   Now showing the amount of time the current query has been running in the
   session summery w/refresh. If the session is active, the time displayed
   is elapsed since the current statement started. If the session is inactive, 
   it's the amount of time elapsed since it became inactive.

   Started adding DDL generation back in, now using the Oracle provided
   DBMS_METADATA package, this will require much less maintenance, and should
   be less buggy. This is available in 9i only, however..

   Show background session summary on main session page, and the active session
   count now excludes these processes.

   Added information pertaining to Peoplesoft, if the database contains a Peoplesoft
   schema. 

   Added latch wait history to Locks / Contends section. Removed session wait info, 
   that's easy enough to get from the session summary section.

   2.1.1   18 Aug 2003

 Bug fixes
==========

   Fixed alignment for numeric columns in databse reports.

   Fixed parameter admiistration so it knows whether to quote the value or not.
   Thanks to William Bourgeois for pointing it out.

   Fixed "describe" command in SQL worksheet to resolve public synonyms and find
   the object to be described. Thanks to Shyamal Thatte for pointing it out.

   Check for Index Organized tables in all Oracle versions > 7, not just 8.0. Thanks
   to Karen Schroeder for code contribution.

   Fixed bug in tablespace / datafile fragmentation output in individual tablespace 
   screen. Thanks to Josian Larcheveque for code contribution.

   Fixed bug when displaying V$SESSION_LONGOPS info in session detailed info screen.
   It was possible to display info from prior sessions with the same SID.

   OS PID resolving correctly now via topsessions screen.

 Enhancements
=============

   Finally changed the hideous default theme to a more tolerable one. Hopefully you
   will like it. It's hard to come up with themes that look nice, and I'm always open
   for contributions.

   Not exactly an enhancement, but monitoring and DDL generation has been removed, I
   don't have the time to maintain it.

   Added several parameters to the oracletool.ini file, you might want to update yours.

   Enhanced the search facility slightly, and added a "?" beside the search box will leads
   to a help screen.

   Added multi-instance reports to database admin section. These reports
   will be run on each instance that Oracletool has valid connection info
   for. For example, if you have previously connected to "testdb" and "proddb"
   then Oracletool can query the connection info from the stored cookie. The
   report will then show various realtime reports for both databases. It's a 
   quick way to see common information across instances that you are responsible
   for.

   Updates to documentation.

   Added hostname to initial screen, > Oracle7.

   OPS-enabled the RMAN monitoring, so all instances will be shown.

   Added logon time to topsessions screen.

   Added additional session_event info to detailed individual session screen.

   Added checks for ORA-1555 errors and tablespace full conditions as pertains
   to undo segments when using automatic undo management. Oracle9i only.

   When displaying a view, the objects that it depends on will be listed, as well 
   as the ojects that depend on the view.

   Many changes to MyOracletool. File uploads now possible, search feature, attach
   files to notes etc. No, there's not an upgrade facility, and the underlying tables
   have changed. Sorry..

   Probably some other stuff I've forgotten about. It's been a long time since a release,
   but I'm gonna try to get busy again.

   2.0   Feb 26, 2002

 News
=====

   This release of Oracletool includes my first crack at
a database monitoring solution via Oracletool. The Oracletool
database monitoring framework should be considered BETA in
this release, and I REALLY need some feedback. I'm not 
really looking for suggestions as to what to monitor yet, 
that's the easy part. I need to know what types of problems 
you ran into when you tried the monitoring so I can update 
the docs, and make enhancements to the installation. If you
try the monitoring at all, please let me know. I need to know
if there is sufficient interest in this to warrant maintaining it.

   Thanks,

     -Adam

 Bug fixes
==========

   Fixed date format error on RMAN backup listing (SCN's). 

   Fixed bug, looking for MD5 module for encryption, should 
   be looking for Digest::MD5. Thanks to Rainer Herbst, Marc 
   Beasley, and the rest of the world for pointing it out.

   Fixed bug with Oracle "i" databases where invalid objects
   by list would not compile due to missing OBJECT_ID is SQL. 
   Thanks to Thomas Lowery and Marc Beasley for pointing it out.

   Put the ENCRYPTION_METHOD parameter back into the oracletool.sam.
   Thanks to Sue Corwin, Matt Brin.

   Fixed bug where Oracletool would loop when it could not 
   write to the debug / log file. Thanks to Richard Chen. 

   Fixed "Controlfiles" display for Oracle9i. Missing info.

   Fixed "Recent events" display for Oracle9i. Missing info.

   Several changes where 9i databases were not taken into consideration,
   and information would not be displayed.

 Enhancements
=============

   Documentation is now in HTML format, and included under the
   "docs" dirdctory.

   Oracletool database monitoring, BETA release. See docs for
   more information. 

   Added interface to DBMS_JOB, the Oracle scheduler, under DB admin.

   Database list on connection screen will now show the last database you
   connected to as the default. Thanks to David Stivers for suggestion.

   Now check for global temporary tables on table listing.
   Oracle "i" databases only.  Thanks to Sue Corwin for suggestion.

   In table row display, if the number of rows returned is less
   than the number requested, the heading will print the actual
   number of rows returned, instead of the number requested. Thanks
   to Ton 't Lam for suggestion.

   Oracletool will now display a more friendly message when a user
   without the required privileges logs in. It would error out before.
   Thanks to Jim Gallagher for the suggestion and code contribution.

   Added option to remove the MyOracletool connection cookie so that
   you may connect to a different repository or create a new one. Thanks
   to Attila Szabó for the suggestion.

   Added note repository to MyOracletool section. I use this area to store 
   Oracle TAR's, config notes, how to cook a baked potato etc.

   Added option to remove the MyOracletool repository completely.

==============================================================================

   1.3.0   Sep 10. 2001

 News
====

  Oracletool is published! Oracletool was chosen as one of
the many tools covered in the Oreilly & Assoc. book 
"Oracle and Open Source" written by Andy Duncan and Sean
Hull, both of which have open source projects of their own.
There are links to these projects from the oracletool.com 
website. Support your Open Source developers and buy this book!
No, I don't get any money from it, but I got a free book.. :)

 Bug Fixes
==========

   Fixed bug where list of usernames with active sessions
was not displaying at all under Netscape when "Session info" 
menu item selected. 

   Fixed bug within session summary with refresh. It was not 
displaying sessions which did not have SQL in the V$SQLTEXT
dynamic performance view associated with them.

   Added comment end tag to javascript code, submitted by many
people.. Thanks!

   Removed references to ORDER_OBJECT_BY_DEPENDENCY view for 
Oracle "i" databases, as it does not exist by default anymore.
Thanks to Svante Sormark for suggestion.

   Several bug fixes to the explain plan section. Not in the way it
is displayed, but the way it creates the correct PLAN_TABLE based
on the version of the database.

 Enhancements
=============

   StatsPack:
      Added rollback stats to display.
      Snapshots can be selected via a range of snapshot ID's.

   Table / View / Column comments are now displayed thanks to 
a code contribution from Praveen Hombaiah.

   Added fragmentation / extent list link to individual tablespace
 screen.

   Began work on "My Oracletool". This will allow you to store scripts
and information in a centralized repository for easy access. Suggestions
please? Constructive criticism? Let me know!

   Many updates to screens pertaining to datafiles, to take TEMPFILES
into consideration. Also, updates pertaining to temporary tablespaces
which use TEMPFILES and are managed locally. Most of these changes are 
transparent unless you have been using these features.

   Added Multi Threaded Server info screen under Perf / Memory section. 
Thanks to Ernesto Hernandez-Novich for the code contribution.

   Added DB buffer cache info to the memory stats page.

   Added modifiable system parameter admin to the DB admin page. This is
also a handy way to display which system parameters are modifiable "on the fly".

   Removed ability to select a temporary or undo tablespace as your default
on the user creation screen. Thanks to Wim Slangewal for suggestion.

   Added state information to index display.

   The following from code contributions from Thomas Lowery. 
   Thanks Thomas, sorry it took me so long!
      Added state information to individual index display.
      Ordered tablespace quotas by tablespace.
      Ordered table partitions.
      Check for UNUSABLE objects as well as INVALID objects in areas that pertain.

   Added CPU usage stat from v$sesstat to Session summary area. This pertains to 
Oracle "i" databases only. Thanks to Sergey Rusakov.

   You may now choose to display detailed session info for all sessions, only active,
or only not active. Thanks to Sergey Rusakov for suggestion.

   Added display for audit trail counts from individual objects. Shows how many times
an object has been selected from, inserted to etc.

   More refresh buttons. I like refresh buttons.. :)

Oracle 9.0 specific additions.

   Oracletool will run against Oracle9i databases with no 
problem. Several enhancements have been made to take advantage
of new 9i features. Surely many more will come. Suggestions?

   Segment management type added to tablespace listing.

   Updates to Rollback segment areas to take into account "TYPE2 UNDO" objects.

==============================================================================

   1.2.2 Dec 10, 2000

 News
=====

   Oracletool no longer requires the explicit 
"SELECT ANY TABLE" privilege to be granted to
connecting users.
   Oracletool is written more from a DBA standpoint than 
developer. In the past, the tool checked for the explicit 
"SELECT ANY TABLE" privilege upon a user logging in. This 
is no longer true. But, because Oracletool depends on so 
many 'DBA%', 'V$%' views, and system level tables, a user 
needs some degree of authority, albeit select only, on these 
data dictionary objects.  In order to make the tool available 
to both DBA and developer, you may want to run the included 
'create_role.sql' script, which will prompt you for a role 
name, which will be created, and may be granted to users who 
are allowed to access data dictionary views, but not rows from 
all tables in the database (SELECT ANY TABLE). The exception is 
that it will not grant privileges to any '%LINK%' views or tables, 
thus preventing said user from obtaining passwords for existing 
database links. This addition is added based on a suggestion
and code submission from Sue Corwin. Thanks, Sue.

 Bug fixes
==========

   mod_perl related change to prevent warnings going to web 
server error log, thanks to Philipp Jocham.

   Fixed StatsPack display for tablespace I/O stats. Bug appeared
for tablespaces with multiple datafiles.

 Enhancements
=============

   The Blowfish method of encryption is now supported. If you
choose to install the Crypt::Blowfish module, please set the
"encryption_method" parameter in the oracletool.ini to blowfish.
An example can be found in the oracletool.sam file. Thanks to
Troy Engel for this enhancement suggestion.

   Added simple javascript goodie to omit lines from
hyperlinks. Thanks to Stanley Martin. I'll be curious
to see if this affects anyone's use. Please let me know
if it does, as this is the first javascript addition.

   StatsPack: Snapshot range delete now works.
              Added datafile I/O stats.

   Added session wait information button to session menu
and performance menu. Both buttons do the same thing. A
display of wait events and wait times for active sessions 
is shown.

   Added drop down list of users with sessions in the instance to
the session menu, for a quick jump to that user's session info.

   Made some changes/additions to the OPS section.

   Added a section for unlocking locked / expired user
accounts to the user admin section.

   Enhanced session wait information.

   DDL generation for tables is now more flexible. You may
select whether or not you want constraints, grants, indexes
etc. generated for given tables.

   Tablespace allocation screen is now sortable by column. 

   Individual tablespace screen will not display all objects
within the tablespace by default anymore. A button will give
you the option to display these objects if any exist.

   Added used extent sizes / counts to individual tablespace screen.

   RMAN active backup channels can now be monitored. You may
do this connected as a normally privileged user such as sys
or system for an online backup, but for an offline backup
you must connect via a user identified in an oracle password 
file created via the "orapwd" command, as the database will
be in mounted mode during this operation. See Oracle documentation
for more information on "orapwd".

   Added RedBrick theme, thanks to Rey Hernandez.

==============================================================================

   1.2.0 Jul 05, 2000

   The change list for 1.2.0 is quite lengthy, but there
are several important points throughout, so please take
a moment to read through.

 News
=====

   Sorry folks, but a new oracletool.ini file needs to 
be installed for this version. I've added a few fields
to it.

   As of 1.2.0, I believe I need to set a firm line on
the lowest Oracle version that will be "supported" by
Oracletool. This version will be 7.3.3. Why? There are
some changes in the Oracle data dictionary between 7.1
and 7.3 that have been causing problems for some users, 
although they have been slight. I just don't have access
to Oracle versions < 7.3 anymore, which means I can't 
test on them.

   Encryption is here! As of 1.2.0 cookies can be encrypted
before they are saved to your PC. I'd like to thank Richard
Chen for pushing me to do this, and for providing some
code to make it easier. Please read the SECURITY file
for more information, and a security advisory which was 
also provided by Richard Chen.


 Bug fixes
==========

In recent events section, log switch count was inaccurate,
and is now fixed. Thanks to Alan Sparks for the fix.

Rollback segment screen now checks for rollbacks which are
not online. Previously these were not shown. Thanks to 
Pascal Lengard for the info.

Now check DBA_CONS_COLUMNS for primary key constraint
column names rather than DBA_IND_COLS, as Oracle8 does
not require a primary key to be created with an index. 
If a suitable index exists, it will be used. Thanks to
Klaus-Martin Hansche for the fix. Hope I got your name
right.. ;)

Fixed a couple of bugs pertaining to foreign keys in table
DDL generation. Thanks to Hirose Masaaki for the info.


 Enhancements: Encryption - Thanks again to Richard Chen
========================================================

   Usernames and passwords for the database instances you
access can now be encrypted before they are sent to your
PC as a cookie. These were being written in plain text
prior to 1.2.0. There are 3 different levels of security
available in Oracletool now. These levels will be enabled
automatically depending on which Perl modules you have 
installed. To find out what level you are at, click on the
"About" menu item after installing v1.2.0. Here are the 
differences between the different levels, and the dependencies
for each...

Level 0: 
      This is the level that Oracletool is at prior to v1.2.0.
   If you are at level 0 then there is no encryption of any
   kind taking place. If you do not have any of the modules 
   discussed below installed, this will be your level. The
   cookie which stores the username and password for the
   databases you access will be stored in plain text on your PC. 

Level 1: 
      This level uses the MIME::Base64 method of encoding. With
   this level, the username, password, and encryption string are
   encoded into a single string. The encryption string is set in
   the oracletool.ini, and is MD5 encoded before being added to
   the string. This level requires the following Perl modules... 
   These modules are available at
   CPAN (http://www.cpan.org) and 
   Activestate (http://www.activestate.com)

1) Digest-MD5
2) Mime-Base64

Level 2: 
      This level uses the cipher block chaining mode with
   the IDEA block cipher, and is extremely secure. It encodes
   the username and password into a single encrypted string 
   based on a keyword stored in the oracletool.ini. This level
   requires the following Perl modules... These modules are 
   available at CPAN (http://www.cpan.org), but not all are
   on the Activestate site when I checked prior to this release.
   This is the only reason that Level 1 encryption exists at all.

1) Digest-MD5
2) Crypt-IDEA
3) Crypt-CBC

   If you choose to use these security features, simply install
the required Perl modules. Oracletool will see the modules and 
start using them for each subsequent cookie that is created. 
See your browser documentation if you want to remove the cookies 
currently on your hard drive.

 Enhancements: General
======================

On tablespace / datafile fragmentation report, an 
"ALTER TABLESPACE tablespace_name COALESCE" statement
will be printed out after the report for any tablespace
containing at least one datafile with more than 1000
fragments. This can be cut and pasted into a worksheet. I
would not recommend using the Oracletool SQL worksheet for
coalesces, as they can be long running. CGI scripts can 
time out.

On tablespace information screen, a listing of the different
extent sizes, and count of each different size of extent
is listed.

Under the DB Admin menu item, the menu has been split into
two parts, one for DB Admin type stuff, and one for reports.

Changed extent report under DB Admin to check for objects
approaching max extents, and also checks each tablespace 
for objects which cannot allocate a next extent. Thanks to
Eric Indiogine for idea.

Added a theme called "Printing", which is a black and white
theme which is good for pages you might want to send to a
printer. Thanks to David Polansky for the theme. I added a
few of my own as well, although I don't recommend them.. :).
Anybody else? Let's see some nice themes!

Added four keywords to each theme definition. You can now
set a background image for the main page, and a different 
one for the menu bar, and you can make the table heading
a different font and color than the cell font.

Explain plan is formatted a bit nicer now, and with more 
information. Thanks to Lefty Kreouzis for suggestion and
code change.

Added global object lock information to OPS section.

Added open cursor information to session statistics screen.
An alert will be shown if the session you are displaying
has the maximum allowed cursors open (OPEN_CURSORS parameter).

Added additional menu under Performance / memory menu item. This
has an entry for the display that already existed, and an additional 
display to show information from the shared SQL area in the SGA. More
to come later, I think.

Added enhancements to the RMAN section, particularly information
obtained from the controlfiles pertaining to backups. RMAN menu
item will show up if your database has been backed up using RMAN,
or contains one or more RMAN catalogs. The most recent backup info
can be displayed, and any datafiles added but not yet backed up 
can be displayed. This section still needs much work. Oracle8 only, 
More to come later.

Added rollback segment administration to the DB admin menu, for 
taking segments online, offline, or shrinking.

The Oracle Statistics Package is a new addition to Oracle with 8.1.6
which is much more powerful than the utlbstat and utlestat scripts.
I will be adding screens to analyze statspack data in the future. For
now, I'm checking for the existence of the PERFSTAT.STATSPACK package
for Oracle 8i databases. A menu item will appear if found. A statspack
snapshot can be taken via point and click. Like the RMAN section, this
section still needs much work. More to come later.

Added datafile autoextend info on full datafile listing and listing
within the individual tablespace screen for Oracle8/8i.

Any object which matches your search via the search box can now be
marked to display the objects which it depends on and the objects 
which depend on it. Quite handy, I've found.

Added menu under rollback segment section. One item for showing RBS info,
one for active or rolling back transaction info. Also enhanced the querys
which display active and rolling back transactions.


   1.04 Apr 26, 2000

 Bug fixes
==========

Fixed bug where Oracletool selects an invalid column from
V$INSTANCE on Oracle7 databases.

   1.03 Apr 25, 2000

 Bug fixes
==========

Fixed bug (again) in Top sessions screen which I had not quite
fixed in 1.02. oops.

Fixed text contained in tables to show HTML characters correctly
instead of interpreting them. <FOO> will show correctly now, for
example, instead of being interpreted as a tag. Thanks to Tommy
Wareing.

Fixed a couple of bugs pertaining to partitioned table / index
displays.

 Enhancements
=============

Added variable for config file, in case you don't want to name it 
"oracletool.ini", requested by Adrian Blakey. Several mod_perl
fixes from Adrian as well.

Added sort area info to performance section. Thanks _again_ to
Tommy Wareing.

OPS page now sorts global sessions by username, and instance names
are hyperlinks which will connect you to that instance.

Added sortable space report by user option to DBA tasks menu.

Added sortable space report by tablespace / user option to DBA 
tasks menu.

Added sortable datafile fragmentation report to DBA tasks menu.
Shows which tablespaces need to be coalesced / reorged.

Added object extent report to DBA tasks menu. You can check for
objects with a number of extents >= the value you enter.

Added screen for object type "CLUSTER".

On table, view, and source object displays, now check for synonyms 
pointing to the object.

Started adding screens for databases which have a RMAN recovery
catalog in them. RMAN button will show up if true. More to come
later on this. Not much to look at now.

On schema table listing, table types are now split up into sections
for partitioned , Index Organized, and standard.

On schema index listing, index types are now split up into sections
for bitmapped, partitioned, Index Organized, and standard.

When you select a role name under the security section, it now also
shows the users which are granted the role, and the roles which are 
granted the role.

Added a button for validating an index after one is selected, which 
will display detailed statistics after the validation. This button
will only show up if you have the "ANALYZE ANY" privilege. This 
utilizes the "VALIDATE INDEX" command.

When a table is selected for display, an "Extent mapping" button will 
show up beside the "Generate DDL" button. This will generate a 
fragmentation map similar to the tablespace / datafile frag maps,
but it will only highlight the extents which belong to the table
you have selected. This is a nice way to get a visual idea of how badly
a table is fragmented. The extents are shown in alternating blue /
white, so you can see where each starts and finishes. If the schema
that you are running the tool as has permission, it will also run
DBMS_SPACE.UNUSED_SPACE to gather real-time space statistics. Extent
mapping is not yet supported for partitioned or Index Organized Tables.

Added optional LIMIT_SEARCH parameter to config file, as suggested
by Mark J. Scheller. Setting this parameter will make the search 
function skip the part where it checks to see if the matched objects
are being accessed by any connected sessions. This part of the search
can be very intensive on instances with many (thousands) of 
simultaneous connections.

On the main page after you select a schema, the object type 
"PUBLIC SYNONYMS" will be displayed with the object types owned by the 
schema. This link will display all public synonyms which point to objects
owned by the schema you have selected. This will only show up if there 
are PUBLIC synonyms pointing to the schema. As suggested by Richard
Chen.

   1.02 Apr 03, 2000   Released without announcement.

Fixed rows which return zeros to show zeros instead of blanks.
Nulls will still show as blank values. Thanks to Hirosi Taguti 
for suggestion.

Top sessions screen had a bug in 1.01 which was giving Netscape
users problems. Fixed, thanks to Tommy Wareing for patch.

On redo log screen, log switch graph now sorts in a way that 
makes sense. This one had me stumped for a long time. Thanks
again to Tommy Wareing for the patch.

   1.01 Mar 31, 2000

** Important ** 
As of 1.00, a config file is required! See entry for v1.00.

Any environmental variable you need to set can now be put in
the oracletool.ini file, not just the ones that are there by default.
Some of you (Thanks, Christoph Karl) may need to set additional
variables like ORA_NLS33, or NLS_LANG, for example. These 
variables can be placed anywhere in the config file, and should
follow the same standard as the other parameters.
...
Example: NLS_LANG = AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P1
Would set $ENV{'NLS_LANG'} = 'AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P1';
Simple as that. No quotes, no $'s, just "PARAMETER = VALUE"

Fixed bug in user DDL generation when setting default roles.

Fixed bug in table DDL for foreign key constraint generation.
Thanks to Stefan Sautter.

Rollback segment screen now shows all transactions on all
segments. Before you had to choose a segment.

Table display now shows the columns that each index spans.

Enhanced constraint displays on table page to include status, 
columns, referenced table, owner, and constraint name.

Enhanced sequence display page. No longer have to click on a 
sequence to get all information.

On table row display, Rows which return space characters will 
display properly now.

Added global session summary to OPS specific page. Note that
the OPS menu item does not show up for non OPS instances.

Added session menu, with "Top sessions" selection. Top sessions
shows all sessions in an instance and has an " auto-refresh"
button. You can sort on any column by clicking on the column
heading. You can display all sessions for a given user by clicking
on the username. You can display an individual session in more 
detail by clicking on the SID.  You may set AUTO_REFRESH in the 
oracletool.ini to a value, in seconds, to override the default of 10.
Note: Sorting on the "SID" column does not work in Oracle 8.1.5
databases. This is an Oracle bug, not an Oracletool bug.

Oracle8 only: Schema list will highlight in red any accounts 
which do not have a status of "OPEN".

User info screen will now show account status in Oracle8.

Added tablespace name column to objects shown in "Recent events"
section.

Working on cleaning up any warnings that should occur for you
diehard "perl -w" users. Many, but not all are gone. Sorry, I 
should have done this from the beginning... :(

   1.00 Feb 10, 2000

** Important ** This config file is required now!

Oracletool now comes with a config file. The reason for this
is so you don't have to set variables at the top of the script
each time you install a new version. The config file is called
"oracletool.sam", and should be renamed to oracletool.ini. The
parameters you need to set have not changed.

Fixed bug in DDL generation from 0.98 which prevented proper 
display with Netscape.

DDL can now be saved to your local disk, and can no longer be
saved to the web server disk. Removed safemode ($safemode).

In individual tablespace display page, tablespace_name is now
a hyperlink which will display DDL for recreating tablespace.

In individual rollback segment display page, segment is now
a hyperlink which will display DDL for recreating segment.

Added rather extensive facility for setting database auditing
options. This facility is under "DB Admin", and will not display
if you do not have auditing enabled. (parameter audit_trail = 'FALSE")
This facility is not perfect yet, so if any of you are auditing, 
please give me some feedback.

You may now browse audit trail records. You can get to this under 
"Security", or under the main auditing menu.

When compiling an invalid object, if the compile is unsuccessful, 
the errors will now be shown. 

Search box will search for usernames and tablespaces that match
your entry, as well as object names, "like" object_names, and 
numeric object ID's.

Removed "Explanation" box at top right of every screen. I don't
think anyone used it, and it's a pain to maintain. I don't expect
that anyone will miss it.

Fixed a couple of partitioned table/index display bugs.

Fixed bug in explain plan query. Thanks to Mark J. Scheller.
Mark, you're an excellent exterminator, thank you.

Fixed shading problem when displaying some HTML tables with
multiple columns.

Added "Recent events" section. This shows all users, roles 
and datafiles added within the last 30 days. Shows objects
that have been created or altered within the last 24 hours.
Shows # of redo log switches in the last 24 hours.

Rollback segments section now checks for any transactions in
the instance that are in an active rollback. Also shows information
about all transactions occupying the rollbacks of the instance you
are connected to.

DDL generation will now generate "alter table" statements for tables
which have foreign keys referencing the table(s) you are generating
DDL for. So, if you do a "Drop table foobar cascade constraints", this
will ensure that all referential integrity constraints for that table
are put in place when it is recreated, including those that reference
that table.

DDL generation will now extract table and column comments.

DDL generation now checks for CACHE attribute on Oracle8 tables. Thanks
to Duc Nguyen. Cache attribute is now shown under table info screen as
well.

Added "$safemode" variable, which disables writing files to the OS for
DDL generation. Output still goes to screen.

When a shema is selected, if the schema has invalid objects, a button
will show up at the bottom of the screen showing the number of invalid
objects. Pressing the button will take you to a display of the objects
where they can be marked for recompile.

Hyperlinks will now only show up on the entity name they pertain to, 
not across the whole row of values. Suggested by Hirosi Taguti.

Added "DB Admin" menu item. This is a work in progress, and more will
be added in the future.. Thanks for the suggestions, keep them coming.

   These menus will activate only if the user logged into the tool has
   the proper privileges to perform the actions.

   User administration:
      Reset user passwords.
      Create users.
      Create users "like" other user. New user will inherit quotas, 
          profile, default TS, temp TS, roles, and system privileges 
          as selected user.
      Drop users.
   Session Administration: 
      Sessions may be marked for kill and killed in batch. Yeah! :) 
   Object administration
      Displays a list of invalid objects, which can be marked for recompile.
   Reverse engineer tables:
      Multiple table names may be entered for reverse engineering of
      DDL. An output filename may be entered to send commands to hardcopy.
      Output will still go to screen as well. Separate section for selecting
      a particular schema. All tables for the schema will be displayed, and
      can be marked for erverse engineering.
   
   0.97   Dec 08, 1999

Many changes in version 0.97, so let me know if you have
problems, and I'll get to them as quick as possible. In
particular, I did some work with the cookies, so let me know 
if you see anything strange with that.

Nifty new look to Oracletool thanks to a suggestion and code 
example from David P. Fannin. Thanks David, looks great! I
think it is safe to say that I took your idea and ran with it!

Oracletool now has color themes which can be chosen interactively,
and the theme you choose will be used each time you use the tool.
Because your theme is stored as a cookie on your browser, each
user of the tool can choose their own theme. Themes can be created
very easily, and there is an explanation in the "doTheme" subroutine,
so if you create a cool theme please send me the values, and I'll
add it to the public version. Most of mine are pretty lame... :(
The themes can be displayed via a button at the bottom of the 
"properties" screen.

A "properties" button has been added. This allows you to set 
defaults that will override the themes. For instance, if you 
like the "Default1" theme, but the font is too small, you can
select a larger font in the properties area. If you have a 
suggestion for something that should be added to the properties
area, let me know. 

Font is much more consistent throughout the tool.

Continuing down the non read-only path, the session listings
will now show a button to kill the session if it is active.
This button will only appear if the user running the tool 
has "ALTER SYSTEM" privilege.  Also, explain plan button 
will show up only if there is SQL to run against.

Session listing layout has changed to save browser space.

Changed the datafile fragmentation display again. Took away the 
hyperlinks. It was too slow, too much bandwidth etc. It's now 
just a display again, and still without GD.pm.

Fixed a bug where a tablespace would not show up in the allocation 
graph if it was 100% full. Thanks to Mark J. Scheller for fix.

Now use more updated DBD::Oracle way to fetch LONGS. Thanks to 
John Williams for fix.

Changed tablespace information listings slightly for Oracle8 and 8i.

Added more detailed tablespace listing to rollback segment area 
showing info about all tablespaces containing rollback segments.
Also added optimal size to display.

Added hyperlink on individual user toplevel page. Username is now
a hyperlink which will generate SQL for recreating the user, setting
defaults, adding grants etc.

If a package / procedure / view etc. is invalid, when selected an error
report will display.

Added "Refresh" button to several screens. This can be added to other
screens very easily as well. Let me know if you want it in other areas.

Many future additions to Oracletool will be non read-only, but the 
options will show up for use only if the user connected has the authority 
to do the action, if possible. Having said this, I'm looking for enhancement
suggestions. What do you want it to do?

Thanks to Alexey Vekshin and Stephane Faroult for suggestions 
pertaining to this release, and several releases before.

   0.96   Nov 15, 1999

The GD.pm module for creating images is no longer used or required.
Because of the copyright problems with the GIF format, there are
two GD.pm versions; One that outputs GIF, and one that outputs PNG.
The one that outputs PNG can be a hassle to install, so I decided
to let it go for the time being. I may look at it again in the future. 

Added (rewrote) EXPLAIN PLAN functionality. Now you can run an
explain plan on any sql shown in the sessions lists, or run
an explain plan from scratch. The main tool window will connect
as the owner of the SQL (password is required), while the menu
will remember who the actual user of the tool is. The username
and password of the explain plan user will not be stored as a cookie
on the client side, as the user running the tool is. This means you
will need to enter a password for each explain plan that you run.
For those of you that found the hidden explain plan facility before,
hopefully you will like this one better. Please let me know of any 
improvements that should be made to this facility.

NOTE: I cannot claim that Oracletool is a 100% READ-ONLY application
any longer, because during an explain plan..

1) If a PLAN_TABLE does not exist for the user executing the SQL,
   Oracletool will create it on the fly (and display a message to
   that effect).
2) During an explain plan, records will (obviously) be added to the
   PLAN_TABLE. These records will have a unique identifier, and will
   be deleted immediately following the explain plan. The PLAN_TABLE
   will not be removed. 

Changed tablespace / datafile fragmentation displays. No longer is 
an image created using GD. Instead, an HTML display is generated, and
each occupied block can be clicked on to display the object which
resides in that block. This may not look as good as it did with the
GD image, but is more functional.

Added top CPU users to Perf / memory section. Requires 
TIMED_STATISTICS = true (which does not produce nearly as much overhead
as many DBA's would have you think).

Fixed SQL worksheet describe command. Was showing columns for
all table names that matched, not just one schema.

Updated / added help screens. I doubt anyone ever looks at them 
anyway.

   0.95   Nov 2, 1999

Oracletool now produces DDL! There is now a "Generate DDL" button 
which will display when you are viewing table information. When
you press the button, Oracletool will reverse engineer the create
table statement, the create index statements, the primary key constraint,
the check constraints, the unique constraints, the foreign key 
constraints, and the grants for that table. All of the DDL is produced
in an easy to read format. This is still Beta, so let me know if you 
see any inaccuracies.

Fixed session statistics screen to show Oracle8i long operation
information correctly.

Split object source display into two columns, one with line numbers
for debug purposes, and one without, for cutting to recreate.
Thanks to Dianne Scott.

Updated partitioned table screens to support Oracle8i.

Added OS port info to banner. This shows the hardware and Operating
System the engine is running on. Pretty neat, although not always 
completely accurate.

Began support for advanced replication (Oracle8 only).

Oracletool will not attempt a connect to the instance unless a valid
cookie is found. It will prompt for the username/password, and cut
down on messages in the sqlnet.trc file

Sessions now sorted by status.

   0.94    Oct 10, 1999

Fixed table column display to show proper length and decimal
precision. Thanks to Phillip Chin.

Added global variable "$gd" to user variables at top of script. 
Oracletool will only look for the GD.pm module if this is set.
This is because of the copyright problems going on with libgd.
GD.pm versions 1.19 and below produce gif images, GD.pm versions
> 1.19 produce png images.

Changed Oracletool to work with both gif and png versions of GD.pm,
(hopefully). Please let me know of bugs.
Thanks to Marcos Colpaert for patch.

Added simple displays for the following object types. INDEXTYPE, 
JAVA CLASS, JAVA RESOURCE, LIBRARY, OPERATOR, QUEUE.

Added session I/O display to sesion stats section.

Fixed fragmentation image generation caching problem. Thanks to
Mark J. Scheller.

   0.93   Sep 09, 1999

Emergency release. 0.92 had a bug which prevented proper menu
display. 

Added V$SESSION_WAIT info to session statistics.

   0.92   Sep 08, 1999

Added controlfile section. Detailed information concerning record
storage for Oracl8 databases. Quite boring for oracle7 databases.

Added object access list to session statistics page under the 
"sessions" section.

Added replication section. Buttons will show up only if you are 
using replication. Separate buttons for master (M) and snapshot (S)
sections. Those of you using replication, please let me know what 
needs to be added / enhanced / fixed here. Oracle8 only

All date / time fields now displayed in HH24 format for consistency.

Added enhancement to DisplayTable etc. subroutines to align number
fields to the right. Looks much nicer. Thanks to Peter Speck.

Fixed bug in Session info for Oracle8i. Looks like we are cool for
Oracle8i now. Thanks to Marc Beasley

Added additional information to table and index listing. Thanks 
to Stephane Faroult (http://www.oriolecorp.com)

Added trigger check on detailed table information page. Thanks
to Stephane Faroult

   0.91   Aug 09, 1999

Added security section - Roles, Profiles, Auditing. Auditing info
is beta, and unfinished.

Fixed tablespace allocation query. Tablespace information screen
and allocation graph are both VERY MUCH faster now. This is a very
positive change for those of you who have many tablespaces, as the
query is now very quick.

Added archived redo log information section.

SQL-Worksheet now supports DESCRIBE / DESC, but it does not follow
synonyms as SQL*Plus describe does, or describe packages, procedures
etc. Does anyone even use the SQL-Worksheet?

Added instance startup date/time to banner. Thanks to Virgil Aviles.

Changed the way SELECT ANY TABLE privileges are checked for.

   0.90   Jul 05, 1999

NOTE: Oracletool.pl now requires the GD.pm module for creating GIF
images. This is the first release to require this module. GD.pm is 
a very reliable and easy to install module. It won't take you but
a few minutes to install it if you don't already have it.

Added datafile fragmentation image generator. When you select a 
datafile, an image will be generated in addition to all of the 
information previously displayed. The image will NOT be written to
disk on your web server. If you want to have a similar map generated 
when you select a tablespace, uncomment line 1981. I have this commented
out by default because some databases have such large tablespaces that
it is just not practical to generate that type of image for them. I'll
let you make the call on this one. Thanks to Mark J. Scheller for the 
idea.

You may enter an OBJECT_ID number in the search box instead of a name
if you need to do such a search.

Added sort information to performance section.

Improved process number resolution in session information area.
Thanks to Michael Roever.

Fixed TO_CHAR format error in tablespace information area.

Made users profile name a hyperlink for a display of parameters / values.

Added "$dbh->{LongReadLen} = 2048;" to DisplayTable subroutine to correct
error on tables with LONG columns. Thanks to Mark J. Scheller.

   0.89   May 18, 1999

Added "where clause" text box for when you display 25 rows of a table or view.

Added a checkbox on the database selector for deleting password cookies.

Added an additional text area on the database selector for those who
are running Oracle Names to type in a connection and let it be resolved 
by names.

Changes GetTNS subroutine to not truncate domain names from connection
strings. Many thanks to Dima Dorofeev for the code contribution.

   0.88   May 12, 1999

Added SQL Worksheet. Can be used for both selects, and DML statements.

Added support for partitioned tables and indexes. Oracle8 only, obviously.

Changed the way the script checks for "SELECT ANY TABLE" privilege. This way
should work better.

Added (somewhat poor) POD documentation.

Took out the hardcoded database name from the search function. Oops. Fixed a couple of 
other bugs too.

Added "EXPLAIN PLAN" subroutine. This is beta and commented out by default. Eventually, 
this tool will have a sister tool for users without "SELECT ANY TABLE" privilege. I
will probably leave explain plan out of this one and add it to that. If you would like to
try the explain plan, uncomment out line 3663. I'll listen to any suggestions you have, 
but I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with this one yet.

    0.87   May 05, 1999

Public release to freshmeat.

Made the object list for tablespaces, datafiles, and object search hyperlinks to info screens.

   0.86   May 04, 1999

I've changed the basic look of the tool quite a bit. There's now a persistent menu on the
left side of the screen for all of the major areas (Tablespaces, Users, Rollbacks etc.).

Added button to show all privileges granted to the selected object.

Added "Performance / memory" area with some of the stuff that was previously under
the initialization parameters section, and some new stuff including info from the
V$LIBRARY_CACHE dynamic performance table. If anyone has a performance
or memory related query that they want to share, please do.

Added query to user info section to show the number of objects the user own of each of
the different object types.

Made object list entries for tablespaces and datafiles clickable links to additional information
screens.

Still working on the daemon....

   0.85    April  28, 1999

OK, OK, I heard you! Cookies are here!! No more password file. I just put this in today,
and have not tested extensively, but it seems to work fine for me. Let me know if any
of you run into problems using the new password system. I'll add a variable for setting
the expiration date later.

Updated session info to display sessions whether they are active or inactive. Previously
displayed only active sessions. Also added "command" column. Handy for seeing if a
transaction is rolling back, cause that's kinda tricky in Oracle.

Not much else this time because I'm spending alot of time writing a daemon to accompany
the tool, which will store historical data in the database (disk I/O, growth, session count info
etc.). I'll probably release that (beta) in about a month or so. It will include some nifty line graphs
created using GIFgraph (GD). This daemon will be optional, and the tool will work with or
without it. The added functionality will display automagically if you are running the daemon.
I will also be looking for help porting it to NT. The tool itsself will remain read-only.

   0.84   March 31,1999

Started adding Oracle Parallel Server specific stuff. Very basic yet. These features will
display only if you are running OPS.

Added help for every screen. Also quite basic. The help button shows up in the footer of
each screen.

Fixed ORA-1476 (Divisor is equal to 0) and inaccurate table analyzation information when
a table that has been analyzed but has no rows is selected.

Changed connection to use 'dbi:DriverName:$database_name' instead of 'old-style'. I guess
this makes me an old timer..

Added object search capability. Searches database for "like" objects, displays them, and
sessions currently accessing them. Search box is at the bottom of every page.

Probably a couple of other little things I've forgotten about.

   0.83   March 23,1999

I decided to change the initial screen to use a "submit" button because
someone reminded me that all browsers do not support Javascript. KDE's 
file manager, for example. I doubt it would have worked with BeOS's 
NetPositive browser either.

I also took away the "Back to the page you came from" link on every page. I 
find I use the "Back" button if I want to go back. Instead, I replaced it with
two buttons. One to go to the "toplevel", where the users are listed, and on
to go to the connections screen. (The first page).

Added a report to show all of a users objects split up by the tablespace's
they reside in. It's a button after a users object types list.

Tested under WinNT4, service pack 4, with IIS4. Worked fine. Added some comments
in the script pertaining to Win32 users. Stuff they probably already know anyway.

    0.82   March 22,1999

Fixed initial database list to accept entries with dashes.

Added object lock info for non-contending object locks.

Fixed bug for OCI that crashed on an ORA-01005 (null password). Thanks 
to Kenny Klatt.

Added hyperlink back to the toplevel page for each page.

   0.78 - 0.81   March 20,1999

Fixed tablespace fragmentation query.

Added LAST_DDL_TIME to tablespace object list.

Only display "show active sessions" button if user has active sessions.

User list table now highlights users that are currently connected, and
   puts users with DBA authority in bold and parenthesis.

Fixed password file update to not use `cp`. Still thinking about whether the
password file is a good idea or not.

Fixed primary key and column constraint queries to check for object ownership.

Fixed initial database list to take off  '.world'  and weed out duplicates from
tnsnames.ora and oratab. Thanks to Dmitry Dorofeev.

Added several additional graphs.

Now use well known (except to me) variable ENV{'SCRIPT_NAME'} to get script name
instead of the stupid way I was doing it before. :-)

   0.78   March 17,1999     Public release to DBI mailing list
